# playpty

This is a tool that reads from a file and simulates user input on tty

## Install

```bash
python3 -m pip install playpty
```

## Usage

```bash
python3 -m playpty /path/to/file.demo

This is only tested in [democtl](https://github.com/wzshiming/democtl)

Maybe it can be used in other places, but it is not guaranteed.
